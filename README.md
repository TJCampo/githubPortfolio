### Adventure Game

The [Adventure Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2653adfb50882214a3a0f7363e3535551fbf012a) was a large project that we worked on for the first half of the semester. It demonstrates all we learned over the semester, including fundamental concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. In the game, the player uses a keyboard-controlled menu to navigate a mysterious forest, and depending on their choices, can get one of three unique endings. 

### Study Application 

The [Study Application](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2880cd4cd0c86db2c71070b6b8763515275e594f) was a useful project that got us to review the information we learned in class and learn new ideas like reading and writing data from external files. Using external .txt files, this program displays definitions and terms about programming, tests your knowledge on them, and gives you a score based on the answers you got right. 

### Explorable Areas

In the [Explorable Areas](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/171722a5144e6eed53d3cbd6bc53d9d7daf63877) program we learned a lot about arrays and their usefulness in avoiding repetition. This game has us explore multiple rooms and talk to NPCs. The NPCs can give us items that are needed to unlock other rooms. 

### Underwater Creatures

In [Underwater Creatures](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/1aa87bc241807f5a6e9913fa414b04df3e1858a7) we tested our knowledge on Inheritence by having multiple derived classes with each acting differently than the other. This program lets us interact and feed different marine creatures. They are all unique. Food that one fish likes won't sit well with another fish.

### Adopt-An-Insect

The [Adopt-An-Insect](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/48c826a790bff29067c6ea32c36a0e188a99a2fa) program was one of the first projects we worked on this semester. It taught us the importance of using multiple classes instead of keeping everything in main. We have multiple insects that can display text on the screen. 

### Shift Cipher

The [Shift Cipher](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/3cf772735f635bb093948ecaf4428ec9f09bac73) was our introduction to arrays. In this program, we take user input and encode it, then display the encrypted message. The program can also decode messages. 

### Trivia Game

The [Trivia Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/aad7b225f22a3649cb64809f6c98e6a8cd2288ae) was a project that went through multiple iterations. We learned how to use arrays, store external files and display them, and other useful things. This trivia program lets the player pick from three different topics and then gets tested based on that topic. The game checks the player's answers and then displays them at the end. The player's score is also saved to an external file which is displayed as high scores.
