## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Adventure Game

The [Adventure Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2653adfb50882214a3a0f7363e3535551fbf012a) was a large project that we worked on for the first half of the semester. It demonstrates all we learned over the semester, including fundamental concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. In the game, the player uses a keyboard-controlled menu to navigate a mysterious forest, and depending on their choices, can get one of three unique endings. 

### Study Application 

The [Study Application](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2880cd4cd0c86db2c71070b6b8763515275e594f) was a useful project that got us to review the information we learned in class and learn new ideas like reading and writing data from external files. Using external .txt files, this program displays definitions and terms about programming, tests your knowledge on them, and gives you a score based on the answers you got right. 

### Explorable Areas

In the [Explorable Areas](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/171722a5144e6eed53d3cbd6bc53d9d7daf63877) program we learned a lot about arrays and their usefulness in avoiding repetition. This game has us explore multiple rooms and talk to NPCs. The NPCs can give us items that are needed to unlock other rooms. 

### Underwater Creatures

In [Underwater Creatures](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/1aa87bc241807f5a6e9913fa414b04df3e1858a7) we tested our knowledge on Inheritence by having multiple derived classes with each acting differently than the other. This program lets us interact and feed different marine creatures. They are all unique. Food that one fish likes won't sit well with another fish.
