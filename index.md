## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### GitHub Portfolio

### Adventure Game

This was a [Mid-Semester Project](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2653adfb50882214a3a0f7363e3535551fbf012a) that demonstrates all of what we learned so far in class including Encapsulation, Inheritance, and polymorphism.



### Study Application 

The [Study Application](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2880cd4cd0c86db2c71070b6b8763515275e594f) was a useful way to review the information we learned in class and to learn how to store and display external files. 



### Explorable Areas

[Explorable Areas](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/171722a5144e6eed53d3cbd6bc53d9d7daf63877) was a way to test our knowledge of arrays, inheritance between classes, and other things we learned in class. The player navigates a world and talks to NPCs and picks up items that are added to an inventory. 



### Underwater Creatures

[Underwater Creatures](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/1aa87bc241807f5a6e9913fa414b04df3e1858a7) shows off multiple classes derived from a base class. These creatures all function differently from one another and the base class they come from, but still, share some similarities. 


### Adopt-An-Insect

The [Insect Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/48c826a790bff29067c6ea32c36a0e188a99a2fa) was a good way to learn about classes and how they can be used to make more organized code. 



### Shift Cipher

The [Shift Cipher](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/3cf772735f635bb093948ecaf4428ec9f09bac73) tested our knowledge of arrays and how to influence player input. In this project, we made a program that could encode and decode player input. 



### Trivia Game

The [Trivia Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/aad7b225f22a3649cb64809f6c98e6a8cd2288ae) was a project that went through multiple iterations. We used our knowledge of arrays, external files, and personally, I learned about how to refractor code to be more simple.
