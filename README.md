## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Adventure Game

The [Adventure Game](https://github.com/TJCampo/githubPortfolio/commit/2653adfb50882214a3a0f7363e3535551fbf012a) was a large project that we worked on for the first half of the semester. It demonstrates all we learned over the semester, including fundamental concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. In the game, the player uses a keyboard-controlled menu to navigate a mysterious forest, and depending on their choices, can get one of three unique endings.
